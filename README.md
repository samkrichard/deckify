# Deckify

**Deckify** is a modular, open-source control and automation framework for Elgato StreamDeck devices, with powerful profile support and flexible integration starting with Spotify.

## Features

- Media control profile (Spotify):
  - Play/pause, next/previous track
  - Volume control via dial
  - Playlist browsing and selection via dial
  - Track browsing within playlists via dial
  - Liked Songs treated as a playlist (full support)
  - Track like/unlike with a single button press
  - Playlist hotkeys (assigned to specific buttons):
    - Tap to play the associated playlist
    - Long press to rebind the button to the currently playing playlist
  - Add-to-playlist mode:
    - Long press the like button to enter add mode
    - While in add mode, tap a playlist hotkey to add the current track to that playlist
    - Mode automatically exits after a short timeout
- Real-time Now Playing display with album art and metadata
- Dynamic button icons and toast notifications
- Configuration driven by JSON profile files
- Designed for easy expansion to additional profiles (system controls, OBS, etc.)

Built using:
- [Spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy)
